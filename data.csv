Type,Scenarios,Details
,,
Plivo API,"Check for 3 new parameters, src property, src country, dst country ",
,Send messages for all combinations ,"Toll free, alphanumeric, long code, Short code "
Queueing Sanity,Checking dequeue and enqueue of rate limit service ,metrics from sharq
,Validate the ack from rate limit service,
,Verify enqueue to sharq NPS ,
RULES,Verify rules for long codes in sms redis,
,Verify rules for short codes in sms redis,
,Verify rules for toll free sms in sms redis,
,Verify rules for USA and Canada src number,
,Verify rules for Non USA and Canada src number,
,Verify rules for any src number,
,Verify rules for USA and Canada dst number,
,Verify rules for Non USA and Canada dst number,
,Verify rules for any destination number,
Database Checks,"Verify Database for checking rules for toll free, short codes, long codes, alphanumeric sms ",
,Verify ryuk for rules as a part of front end check,
,Add NPS in ryuk for a region,
,Verify DB and Elastic Cache for NPS data,
,Verify enqueue to sharq NPS ,
MPS and NPS Checks,Set MPS for a account and NPS and check the behaviour of the system ,
,Set MPS to 1 for long code and check the behaviour,"1. Src and Dst from USA and Canada region
2. Src - USA and Canada Region, Dst - Non USA and Canada region
3. Src - Non USA and Canada, dst - USA and Canada Region
4. Src and Dst from Non USA and Canada Region "
,Set MPS to 40 for Short code and check the behaviour,Check for any src and dst short code numbers.
,Set MPS to 10 for  and check the behaviour,"1. src - USA and Canada, Dst - Any"
,Verify Configuarations in RYUK after changes ,
,Verify the timings after enqueue and dequeue,
,Insert Floating point values in redis for NPS and check the system. ,
,Set various MPS and NPS combinations and check the system,"1. MPS = LOW , NPS =LOW
2. MPS = HIGH, NPS =HIGH
3. MPS = LOW, NPS = HIGH
4. MPS = HIGH, NPS = LOW
5. Corner case scenarios "
Load Testing ,Verifying Deque and Enque of sharq servers after running load testing,
,Verifying Redis Cluster while doing Load Testing for Sharq NPS,
,Perform Load test on the system and observe the output. ,For maximum MPS 
,Making one nps instance down and running the load ,
Negative Scenarios ,,
,Down one mps sharq server and check the system ,"1. Making MPS Down - Should retry for 5 times
2. Making Nps Down - Should requeue 
3. Making both down - retry for 5 times "
,Down one nps sharq server and check the system ,
,Down both nps sharq servers and check the system ,
,Down both mps sharq servers and check the system ,
,"In NPS, If Enqueue happens and dequeue does not happen ",
,"In NPS, If Enqueue does not happen and dequeue happens ",
,"In MPS, If Enqueue happens and dequeue does not happen ",
,"In MPS,  If Enqueue does not happen and dequeue happens ",
,What if it is not able to pick a rule from redis ,
,"What if plivo api does not add src property, src country, dst country ",
,What if redis and dbcfg goes down ,
